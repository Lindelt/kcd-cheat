# KCD Cheat
Updated version of [pryans](https://github.com/pryans/kcd-cheat) KCD Cheat Mod: https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance/mods/106

## Why another fork?
When creating new mods, KCD Cheat has become indispensable for me. It includes numerous functions that makes mod testing a lot easier.

During testing, I noticed that using the **cheat_remove_all_stolen_items** and **cheat_own_all_stolen_items** commands sometimes remove quest items from the inventory. I immediately wanted to fix this behavior. 

So I looked pyrans repository and forked it. I noticed that there are 12 different forks, all of which offer small changes and bug fixes.

What could be more obvious than merging the changes from the various repositories. Especially the changes of [JoewAlabel](https://github.com/JoewAlabel/kcd-cheat), [Lernos](https://github.com/Lernos/kcd-cheat) and [MagicGonads](https://github.com/MagicGonads/kcd-cheat) offer some useful extensions and fixes.
